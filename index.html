<html>
  <head>
    <!-- The head tag allows us to place things like our page icon and title in our website while still keeping the rest of our code clean -->
    <title>My amazing website</title>
    <!-- For this example, I will just add a title to the page -->
  </head>
  <!-- The <h1> tag stands for heading 1, just like in Microsoft Word -->
  <h1>My amazing website</h1>
  <!-- The <p> tag stands for paragraph, this is what you use for body text in HTML -->
  <p>I like to create websites</p>
  <!-- You can use the <b> tag for bold text, the <i> tag for italics, and the <u> tag for underline text -->
  <p><b>This is bold text</b></p>
  <!-- You can also make hyperlinks with the <a> tag in HTML -->
  <a href="https://google.com">A link to Google</a>
  <!-- Oh! I almost forgot, you can use these <!-- tags to put comments in your code. These do not show up in the actual website. -->
<!-- Once we're done, it's a good practice to put a </html> tag at the very botton of your website -->
